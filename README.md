# Get_best_price_webversion

This is web based implementation of original <a href="https://github.com/Abhishek-2k19/Get_best_price">Get_best_price</a> project developed by me. This web app is live at getbestprice2021.pythonanywhere.com

## Usage
You need to enter the fl\*pkart url of your favourite product and click on submit. It will show it's price history plot. Note : If it's first time when app came across a particular url entered by you, then it will show only single entry and it will continue to monitor its price everyday. After few days if you enter the same url in space provided, then it will show interactive price plot which can help you purchase your favourite product at best price and it will manage the boring job of entering fl\*pkart and searching its price everyday! Pretty cool right :) 

## Errors
This application is currently in development and you may came across errors, but we gonna fix it very soon! Stay tuned
